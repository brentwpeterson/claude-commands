# Resume Instructions for Claude

## IMMEDIATE SETUP
1. **Change directory:** `cd /Users/brent/scripts/CB-Workspace/brent-workspace`
2. **Verify branch:** `git branch --show-current` (should be: main)
3. **Run:** `/brent-start` to load daily operating system

## SESSION METADATA
**Last Commit:** `0264537 Add SMS idea capture plan - Twilio to RequestDesk integration`
**Saved:** January 1, 2026

## WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED THIS SESSION

### Dec 31 - Brain Dump & Time Tracking
- Created `/brent-finish` command for day closeout with todo review
- Updated `/brent-start` with time tracking + daily non-negotiables
- Created `WORK-LOG.md` for tracking hours
- Added blocker chain framework to MASTER-COMMITMENTS.md
- Added daily non-negotiables: Clear HubSpot tasks, Review CC CSS
- Added MiMS fundraising (weekly video until June 21)
- Added SMS idea capture plan to idea-stash
- Logged Dec 31: 11.5 hours (4:15 AM - 3:49 PM)

### Jan 1 - HubSpot Task Triage
- Cleared 23+ stale HubSpot tasks (most were Fireflies auto-generated from May 2025)
- Established pattern: tasks older than 6 months with no context get closed
- Kept 7 actionable tasks for follow-up

### Jan 1 - Partner Email Sequence (IN PROGRESS)
- Researched Mia Murphy / Tontine.ai (price optimization for Shopify brands)
- Drafted 5-email sequence `SEQ-PARTNER-001` for partner outreach
- Template designed to be reusable
- **NOT YET SAVED TO FILE** - emails drafted in conversation only

## DRAFT EMAIL SEQUENCE (SEQ-PARTNER-001)

**Prospect:** Mia Murphy, Co-Founder & CRO at Tontine.ai
**Company:** Price optimization platform for Shopify/Shopify+ (Steve Madden, FashionNova, K-Swiss)
**Angle:** RequestDesk partnership - co-marketing + integration listing
**Cadence:** 7-7-7-14-14 days (relaxed)

**Email 1:** Partnership intro (highly personalized for Mia)
**Email 2:** Value add (template - share relevant resource)
**Email 3:** Social proof (template - case study example)
**Email 4:** Direct ask (template - 15 min meeting)
**Email 5:** Breakup (template - closing the loop)

**User feedback:** User stopped me from creating HubSpot custom properties (sequence_code, sequence_step, partnership_interest) - HubSpot already handles sequence tracking natively. Don't over-engineer.
