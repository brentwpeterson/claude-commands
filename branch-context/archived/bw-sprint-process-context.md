## WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED THIS SESSION

### Sprint Process Improvements (Major)
1. **Day-aware inbox protocol** - Monday = 75 min extended (added to /brent-start)
2. **Mid-sprint review** - Monday Week 2 trigger (Step 6.5 in /brent-start)
3. **Max 3 pts per story IN SPRINT** - Backlog can have large items, breakdown at planning
4. **Track actual time on completion** - Claude asks "how long did that take?" (Rule 5 in accountability-mode.md)
5. **Running retro-notes.md** - Capture issues as they happen, not just Friday
6. **Rock work → sprint stories** - Must create sprint stories for rock work during planning
