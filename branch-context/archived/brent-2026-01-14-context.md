3. **Date:** 2026-01-14 (resume from here)

## SESSION SUMMARY (Evening Session)

- **8 social posts scheduled:** Via Vista Social API (Jan 16-28), link in first comment
- **Vista Social docs added:** To content-schedule.md skill, including API reference and profile IDs
- **HubSpot tasks created:**
  - S0 checkin with Isaac (Jan 20) - Task #101228266333

- **P0-B started:** LinkedIn Newsletter Quarterly Plan - platform series format designed

### P0-B Progress (LinkedIn Newsletter Quarterly Plan)
**Format designed but topics not assigned yet.**

Proposed platform series alternating Commerce + DXP:

| Week | Date | Platform | Type |
|------|------|----------|------|
| 2 | Jan 8 | Shopify | DONE Commerce |
| 3 | Jan 15 | Gartner MQ Overview | DONE Both |
| 4 | Jan 22 | Optimizely | DXP |
| 5 | Jan 29 | Adobe Commerce | Commerce |
| 6 | Feb 5 | Contentstack | DXP |
| 7 | Feb 12 | BigCommerce | Commerce |
| 8 | Feb 19 | Acquia | DXP |
| 9 | Feb 26 | Salesforce Commerce | Commerce |
| 10 | Mar 5 | Uniform | DXP |
| 11 | Mar 12 | commercetools | Commerce |
| 12 | Mar 19 | VTEX | Commerce |
| 13 | Mar 26 | SAP Commerce | Commerce |

**Format per platform overview:**
- Hook (why this platform matters right now)
- Who It's For (ideal merchant profile)
- What It Does Well (3-5 strengths)
- What to Watch (honest cautions)
- The Hidden Story (unique insight)
- Verdict (when to choose, when to skip)

**NEXT:** User needs to confirm/adjust the order, then we can finalize P0-B.

### Backlog Items Added
- Create /update-backlog command (ID: 6968ed91ce19f740f37d3910)
- Update /brent-finish to use backlog API (ID: 6968ed95ce19f740f37d3911)

### Key Learnings
- Vista Social API: `https://vistasocial.com/api/integration` (NOT api.vistasocial.com)
- `comments` array parameter puts link in first comment
- Always run /brand-brent terms checker before scheduling social posts

## TODO LIST STATE
- P0-B: LinkedIn Newsletter Quarterly Plan - IN PROGRESS (format done, topics need confirmation)

## NEXT ACTIONS
1. **Confirm P0-B platform order** - User needs to approve the DXP/Commerce mix
2. **S1 ends Friday Jan 16** - Limited time Thu/Fri per user
3. **R1-1 Email sequence** - Still has 290 contacts to enroll
4. **B1 contentbasis.io redirect** - Quick win, not started

## USER AVAILABILITY NOTE
User has **limited time Thu Jan 15 and Fri Jan 16**. Prioritize accordingly.
