## SESSION STATUS
**Identity:** Claude-Hawking
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Last Saved:** 2026-02-07 14:45
**Last Started:** 2026-02-08

## IMMEDIATE SETUP
1. **Directory:** `cd /Users/brent/scripts/CB-Workspace`

3. **Last Commit:** `90dcc88` Add LinkedIn post drafts: ChatGPT commerce layer + brands invisible to LLMs
4. **Verify:** `git status`

## WORKSPACES TOUCHED
| Shortcode | What was done |
|-----------|---------------|
| brent | LinkedIn post drafts written to Obsidian |
| cc | Claude-comms with Feynman, backlog API updates, content terms update |

## WHAT YOU WERE WORKING ON
Content creation session focused on LinkedIn posts from a podcast pitch conversation about AI and eCommerce. Also handled backlog management, sprint tracking, and inter-Claude comms.

## CURRENT STATE
- **Files modified:** 2 LinkedIn posts committed to Obsidian
- **Backlog updates:** 4 LinkedIn posts added to S3 sprint, 1 completed, 1 security audit item added
- **Content terms:** Added "excessive adverbs and adjectives" as conditional term (humor exception)
- **Comms:** Received RBAC testing status from Claude-Feynman

## TODO LIST STATE
- Completed: ChatGPT commerce data layer LinkedIn post (saved to Obsidian, backlog marked complete)
- In Progress: Brands invisible to LLMs post (draft in Obsidian, needs Brent's real workshop opening)
- Pending: AI agents 30-40% of product decisions post (target Wed Feb 11)
- Pending: Google Universal Commerce Protocol post (target Thu Feb 12)

## NEXT ACTIONS
1. **FIRST:** Brent fills in real Meet Magento Florida opening on the LLMs post
2. **THEN:** Draft AI agents post (Feb 11 target)
3. **THEN:** Draft Google UCP post (Feb 12 target)
4. **REVIEW:** RBAC test plan at `documentation/docs/technical/rbac/ticket-rbac-test-plan.md` (from Feynman)

## CONTEXT NOTES
- Brand-brent persona loaded this session. Key rules: no em dashes, no fabricated content, sparse adverbs/adjectives (exception for humor), first person voice, LinkedIn posts use plain text (no markdown)
- The "brands invisible to LLMs" post opening was flagged as fabricated. Content from Claude-written newsletter draft was incorrectly treated as fact. Placeholder left for Brent to fill in real experience.
- Content terms API does not support updating term_type after creation (POST only, no PATCH/PUT/DELETE on that endpoint)
- Feynman (rd-test) reports RBAC Phase 1 done and merged. Phase 2 gaps ready for prioritization.

## DEFERRED QUESTIONS
- Time tracking for this session?
- Task status updates for sprint items beyond LinkedIn posts?
