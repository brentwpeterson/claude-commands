- **Notes file:** `/Users/brent/scripts/CB-Workspace/brent-writing/ob-notes/Brent Notes/idea-stash/2025-top-5-newsletter-notes.md`
- **Brand voice:** `/Users/brent/scripts/CB-Workspace/.claude-local/commands/brand-brent.md`

## BRAND VOICE RULES (CRITICAL)
- No colons in titles
- No em dashes (—)
- No "just published", "what struck me", "here's the thing"
- Direct, confident statements
- What/So What article structure
- LinkedIn does NOT support H3 tags

## CONTEXT NOTES
- Issue 27 = 6 months of newsletter
- 2026 theme: Gratitude - finding something good in everything
- Article ends with reader-focused call to action: "What will you contribute to your community next year?"
- Brent wants readers to feel INSPIRED TO CONTRIBUTE, not focused on him
