# EMERGENCY CONTEXT SAVE - 2026-02-17
## CRITICAL: LOW CONTEXT SAVE
## BRANCH: N/A (workspace root, not a git repo)
## DIRECTORY: /Users/brent/scripts/CB-Workspace
## WHAT WE WERE DOING:
- Writing Wednesday LinkedIn newsletter about HCL (Gartner MQ DXP/Commerce profile)
- Article is DRAFT at: `brent-workspace/ob-notes/Brent Notes/Newsletters and Blogs/LinkedIn Agentic Commerce Guy/Newsletter/2026-02-19-hcl-dxp-ibm-legacy.md`
- Title: "HCL. Enterprise Commerce Without the Drama"
- Article has LinkedIn Meta block (title, subtitle, SEO description, topics)
- Ran brand-brent terms checker twice, article passes
- Was about to create Canva cover image when save triggered
- Brent rejected the Canva linkedin_banner tool call

## PENDING TODOS:
1. **CREATE COVER IMAGE** for newsletter (Canva) - was in progress
2. **PUBLISH newsletter** to LinkedIn by Wednesday Feb 19
3. **INBOUND 2026 Submission 2** - DONE (submitted today, file updated)
4. **HubSpot tasks** - 2 due today (Zero 1 Sales Pro, logo on page) - NOT DONE
5. **Remaining inbox** - Guillermo/HubSpot, Sophia Cao/podcast, Shoptalk profile - NOT DONE
6. **TWC Medium link** - checked, no article found for today
7. **Shopify one-pager** - Brent says in progress (due Feb 20)
8. **Sprint work** - Define ICPs (Rock 1 foundation)

## KEY FILES MODIFIED:
- `Newsletter/2026-02-19-hcl-dxp-ibm-legacy.md` - NEW article draft with LinkedIn meta

- `_linkedin-patterns.md` - Added "I've been in X since Y" to rejected phrases, upgraded "Actually" to NEVER USE

- `.claude/claude-comms/faraday-to-other-vista-social-api-posting.md` - Added Vista Social API reply for Claude-Faraday

## CRITICAL STATE:
- Identity: Claude-Faraday (originally started as Hemingway session, compacted and resumed as Faraday)
- Newsletter needs cover image + publishing by Wed Feb 19
- Article content is ready, passed brand check
- Canva brand kits available: Talk Commerce, Content Cucumber, EO Visionary Voices, RequestDesk, Content Basis (no Agentic Commerce Guy kit)
- Existing Canva design "AgenticCommerceGuy" ID: DAGxvXWSgIQ (3 pages)

## NEXT STEPS:
