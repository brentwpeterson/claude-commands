13. **Full Marketing Department** - $8,000/mo (40+ hrs)
14. **All add-ons** across all services now have real prices

**Key decisions made:**
- AIO dropped as a service (market doesn't support it as distinct from AEO/GEO)
- AEO renamed to AEO/GEO to match market terminology
- LLM Discovery positioned as gateway audit to AEO/GEO retainer
- Webinar "full production" scope defined (was previously undefined)
- Content repurposing bundle priced at $750/webinar add-on

### Market Research Completed
Ran 4 parallel research agents covering:
- AEO/GEO/AIO market terminology and packaging
- Competitive intelligence agency pricing
- Webinar production agency pricing
- Store optimization, sales enablement, CRO, marketing automation, fractional CMO pricing

### Obsidian Review Document
Created `Sales and Marketing/service-pricing-review.md` in Obsidian for Brent to review all pricing. NOTE: This document was created BEFORE the final round of pricing was filled in. It needs to be regenerated to include the latest numbers.

## CURRENT STATE
- **Files modified:** `.claude/skills/proposal-creation/service-types.md` (major updates - all pricing filled)
- **Committed:** Yes, `91ab833`
- **Tests run:** None (content/pricing work)
- **Issues found:** None
- **Obsidian review doc:** Needs regeneration with final numbers

## TODO LIST STATE
- Completed: All internal fee grid pricing for 24 services
- Completed: AEO/GEO restructuring and pricing
- Completed: Competitive intel scope and pricing
- Completed: Webinar scope definition and pricing
- Completed: All remaining add-on pricing across all services
- Pending: Obsidian review document needs refresh with final numbers
- Pending: Brent to review all pricing and adjust

### Still pending from previous session:
- Shopify one-pager review in Canva (separate from pricing, parked)
- Sprint S3 items (ends Feb 13, 2 days left)
- 3 approved sprint tooling fixes

## NEXT ACTIONS
1. **FIRST:** Regenerate Obsidian review document with complete pricing
2. **THEN:** Brent reviews all pricing in Obsidian and provides feedback
3. **OR:** Move to Sprint S3 items (2 days remaining)
4. **OR:** Shopify one-pager review in Canva

## KEY FILES
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.claude/skills/proposal-creation/service-types.md` | Complete service catalog with all 24 services, fully priced |
| `brent-workspace/ob-notes/.../Sales and Marketing/service-pricing-review.md` | Obsidian review document (needs refresh) |

## CONTEXT NOTES
- All pricing based on market research from parallel agents
- $200/hr is the base rate across all hourly services
- Proposal template sections still use $X,XXX intentionally (filled per client)
- Sprint S3 ends Friday Feb 13 (was 6 open items as of Feb 10)
- Canva MCP auth works (from previous session)

## DEFERRED QUESTIONS
- Time tracking status for this session
- Which sprint items to prioritize for final 2 days
- Whether to regenerate Obsidian review doc now or wait for pricing feedback
