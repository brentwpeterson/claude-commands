## What I Was Working On
- Added Webador (webador.com) to RequestDesk backlog as potential platform integration (ticket 69855976647e4102d805d0d6)
- Designed and spec'd a **Screenshot Manager** file utility (Option D - Hybrid approach)
- Sent comms to Claude-Curie with full build spec for `brent-workspace/skunk-works/file-utils/`

## Key Files
- Comms file: `.claude/claude-comms/lovelace-to-curie-file-utils-agent.md`
- Backlog item: Webador integration research (priority 4, tags: integration, platform, research)

## Screenshot Manager Spec (sent to Curie)
Three-layer hybrid approach:
1. **Layer 1:** Rule-based auto-triage (age, size, duplicates)
2. **Layer 2:** Interactive CLI review (keep/move/rename/delete)
3. **Layer 3:** AI categorization stub (future Claude Vision API)

Target directory: `brent-workspace/skunk-works/file-utils/`

## Resume Instructions
- Check if Claude-Curie built the file-utils agent
- If not built yet, could pick it up directly
- Check comms for any replies from Curie
