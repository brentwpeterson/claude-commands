# Ongoing Issues Tracker

Systemic problems that recur, aren't anyone's fault, and need tracked solutions.

**Not violations** (Claude broke a rule). **Not learning moments** (one-time calibration gaps). These are **system-level friction** that happens repeatedly until fixed.

## Format

Each issue gets an entry with:
- **Description:** What keeps happening
- **Occurrences:** When it happened (date + brief context)
- **Impact:** What it costs (time, frustration, broken mornings)
- **Root cause:** Why it keeps happening
- **Proposed fix:** What would stop it
- **Status:** open, in-progress, fixed
- **Fixed date:** When it was resolved

## When to log an issue

- Same problem happens 2+ times across sessions
- It's not a rule Claude broke (that's a violation)
- It's not a one-time gap (that's a learning moment)
- It's a systemic friction point that needs engineering or process work
