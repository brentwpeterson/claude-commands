Claude Session Save - Create Resume Instructions + Preserve Work

**USAGE:** `/claude-save <project>` - Save work + create handoff instructions for next Claude session

**üéØ PURPOSE:**
Create comprehensive INSTRUCTION FILE for next Claude to resume exactly where you left off

**üìã COMPLETE SAVE WORKFLOW:**

**Phase 1: Work Preservation**
1. **Check Development Status:**
   - Run `git status` to capture exact file states
   - Analyze changes to understand what work was completed
   - Ensure no sensitive files (.env, keys, etc.) are included

2. **Commit Development Work:**
   - Stage all relevant development files: `git add [relevant-files]`
   - Create descriptive commit message based on changes
   - Format: `git commit -m "[Description of work completed] ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code"`
   - **IMPORTANT**: Commit actual development work FIRST before context

**Phase 2: Create Handoff Instructions**
3. **Create Resume Instruction File:**
   - Get current branch: `git branch --show-current`
   - Get working directory: `pwd`
   - **MANDATORY: Get current todo path** - Ask user if not obvious
   - Check running processes: `docker ps`, `lsof -i :3000`, etc.
   - Create: `.claude/branch-context/[branch-name]-context.md`
   - **Format as INSTRUCTIONS TO CLAUDE**, not status report:

# Resume Instructions for Claude

## IMMEDIATE SETUP
1. **Change directory:** `cd [exact-working-directory]`
2. **Verify git status:** `git status` (expect: [list files])
3. **Check processes:** `docker ps` (expect: [containers running])
4. **Verify branch:** `git branch --show-current` (should be: [branch])

## CURRENT TODO FILE
**Path:** file:[exact-path-to-todo-readme]
**Status:** [Working on step X of Y - specific current focus]

## WHAT YOU WERE WORKING ON
[Clear description of the task in progress]

## CURRENT STATE
- **Last command executed:** [exact command]
- **Files modified:** [list with status]
- **Tests run:** [what was tested, results]
- **Issues found:** [any blockers or problems]

## TODO LIST STATE
[Current TodoWrite items with exact status]
- ‚úÖ COMPLETED: [task]
- üîÑ IN PROGRESS: [task]
- ‚è≥ PENDING: [task]

## NEXT ACTIONS (PRIORITY ORDER)
1. **FIRST:** [exact command to run]
2. **THEN:** [next command]
3. **VERIFY:** [how to check it worked]

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS
- Check feature: [command]
- Test endpoint: [curl/url]
- View logs: [log command]

## CONTEXT NOTES
[Any important details, gotchas, or background]
```

4. **Update CLAUDE.md Header (Optional):**
   - Add brief status to project CLAUDE.md if needed
   - Keep minimal - main instructions are in context file

**Phase 3: Context Commit + Display Path**
5. **Commit Instructions:**
   - Stage context files: `git add ../.claude/branch-context/`
   - Commit with: "Save resume instructions for session restart"

6. **END BY SHOWING CONTEXT FILE PATH:**
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: If todo path doesn't exist, STOP and ask user to clarify
   - Display: "üìÅ Resume instructions saved to: `.claude/branch-context/[branch-name]-context.md`"

**üéØ KEY CHANGES:**
- **Creates INSTRUCTION FILE** instead of status report
- **Ends with context file path** for next session
- **Includes everything needed** for immediate resume
- **Ready for `/claude-start` to read and execute**

**üîÑ EXPECTED WORKFLOW:**
1. `/claude-save <project>` ‚Üí Creates instruction file, shows path
2. `/clear new` ‚Üí Clear current session
3. `/claude-start <project>` ‚Üí Reads instruction file and resumes
