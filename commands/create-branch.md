# DEPRECATED - Use /start-work instead

**This command has been replaced by `/start-work`**

```
⚠️ /create-branch is deprecated

The new /start-work command provides:
- Smart questions to determine the right setup
- Mandatory acceptance criteria
- Support for backlog, planning, and implementation phases
- Better flexibility (branch creation is optional)

Redirecting to /start-work...
