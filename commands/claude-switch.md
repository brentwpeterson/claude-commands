# /claude-switch Command

**Purpose**: Smart branch switching with context preservation, security validation, and automatic sync with master.

## Usage
```
/claude-switch <branch-name>
```

## Examples
```
/claude-switch feature/api-integration
/claude-switch fix/auth-bug
/claude-switch master
```

## What This Command Does

**üîÑ SMART BRANCH SWITCHING WITH CONTEXT**

This command provides intelligent branch switching that:
- Preserves current branch context before switching
- Validates target branch exists (offers to create if not)
- Checks for uncommitted changes and handles appropriately
- Syncs target branch with master if behind
- Loads target branch context after switching
- Performs security scan on the target branch

## Detailed Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-Switch Validation
1. **Check Current State**
   ```bash
   git status --porcelain
   ```
   - If uncommitted changes exist:
     ```
     ‚ö†Ô∏è UNCOMMITTED CHANGES DETECTED
     
     Modified files:
     - backend/api/users.py
     - frontend/src/components/UserList.jsx
     
     Options:
     [S] Stash changes and switch
     [C] Commit changes first
     [D] Discard changes (dangerous!)
     [A] Abort switch
     
     Choice [S/c/d/a]: _
     ```

2. **Security Scan Current Branch**
   - Quick scan for any security issues to document
   - Add findings to branch context if any exist

3. **Save Current Branch Context**
   - Use same logic as `/claude-close` Phase 2
   - Create/update: `.claude/branch-context/[type]-[branch]-context.md`
   - Include:
     - Current work status
     - Security findings
     - Any in-progress tasks from TodoWrite
     - Recovery instructions

### Phase 2: Branch Validation & Creation
4. **Check Target Branch**
   ```bash
   git branch -a | grep -E "(^|\s)${branch_name}($|\s)"
   ```
   
   - If branch doesn't exist locally or remotely:
     ```
     ‚ö†Ô∏è BRANCH NOT FOUND: feature/api-integration
     
     Would you like to:
     [C] Create new branch from current HEAD
     [M] Create new branch from master
     [O] Create from origin/master (fetch first)
     [A] Abort switch
     
     Choice [C/m/o/a]: _
     ```

   - If exists only remotely:
     ```
     üì° REMOTE BRANCH FOUND: origin/feature/api-integration
     
     Creating local tracking branch...
     ```

### Phase 3: Execute Switch
5. **Perform Switch**
   ```bash
   # If stashing was chosen:
   git stash push -m "claude-switch: Stashing for branch switch to ${branch_name}"
   
   # Switch to branch:
   git checkout ${branch_name}
   
   # If creating new branch:
   git checkout -b ${branch_name}
   ```

6. **Check Sync with Master**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin master
   BEHIND=$(git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/master)
   ```
   
   - If behind master:
     ```
     üìä BRANCH STATUS: ${BEHIND} commits behind master
     
     Would you like to:
     [M] Merge master into ${branch_name} (recommended)
     [R] Rebase onto master
     [C] Continue without syncing
     [V] View differences first
     
     Choice [M/r/c/v]: _
     ```

### Phase 4: Post-Switch Setup
7. **Load Target Branch Context**
   - Check for `.claude/branch-context/[type]-[branch]-context.md`
   - If exists, display summary:
     ```
     üìÇ BRANCH CONTEXT LOADED: feature/api-integration
     
     Last worked: 2 days ago
     Status: In progress - implementing user endpoints
     Security: ‚úÖ Clean (last scan: 2025-09-02)
     
     Recent work:
     - Added user CRUD endpoints
     - Implemented authentication middleware
     - TODO: Add rate limiting
     ```

8. **Security Scan New Branch**
   ```
   üîí SECURITY SCAN: feature/api-integration
   [‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà] 100% - Scanning for security issues
   
   ‚úÖ No critical issues
   ‚ö†Ô∏è 1 warning: Hardcoded localhost URL in config.py:45
   ```

9. **Update TodoWrite**
   - Clear current todos (they belong to previous branch)
   - Load todos from branch context if available
   - Or start fresh if new branch

10. **Apply Stashed Changes (if applicable)**
    ```bash
    # If stash was created:
    git stash pop
    ```
    - Handle any merge conflicts if they occur

### Phase 5: Summary & Next Steps
11. **Present Switch Summary**
    ```
    ‚úÖ SUCCESSFULLY SWITCHED TO: feature/api-integration
    
    üìä Branch Status:
    - Type: Feature branch
    - Commits ahead of master: 3
    - Commits behind master: 0 (synced)
    - Last commit: 2 hours ago
    
    üîí Security Status: Clean
    
    üìã Loaded Context:
    - Previous work: Implementing API integration
    - Next steps: Add error handling and retry logic
    
    Ready to continue work on this branch!
    ```

## Special Cases

### Switching to Master
When switching to master, offer to:
- Pull latest changes from origin/master
- Clean up merged branches
- Show deployment status

### Switching from Dirty State
If the working directory has changes:
- Intelligently determine if changes belong to current or target branch
- Offer to carry changes over if they're relevant
- Warn about potential conflicts

### Creating New Feature Branch
When creating a new branch:
- Suggest conventional naming (feature/, fix/, refactor/)
- Ensure branch starts from latest master
- Initialize branch context file
- Set up initial TodoWrite tasks

## Integration with Other Commands

- **Before `/claude-close`**: Use `/claude-switch` to change branches without full session close
- **After `/claude-start`**: Use if you realize you're on wrong branch
- **With `/claude-complete`**: Complete current branch, then switch to next task
- **With `/project:create-branch`**: Alternative for existing branches

## Error Handling

**Merge Conflicts During Sync**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è MERGE CONFLICTS DETECTED

Conflicts in:
- backend/api/config.py
- frontend/package.json

Options:
[R] Resolve conflicts interactively
[A] Abort merge and stay on current branch
[S] Skip sync for now

Choice [R/a/s]: _
```

**Network Issues**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è UNABLE TO FETCH FROM ORIGIN

Cannot check if branch is behind master.
Continue with local branch state? [Y/n]: _
```

## Security Considerations

- Never switch branches with exposed API keys or credentials
- Always scan target branch before starting work
- Document any security debt in branch context
- Warn if switching away from branch with security issues

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Smooth branch switching with zero data loss
‚úÖ Context preserved and restored accurately  
‚úÖ Security validated on both source and target branches
‚úÖ Master sync handled intelligently
‚úÖ Uncommitted changes handled safely
‚úÖ Clear communication throughout process
