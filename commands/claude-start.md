Claude Session Start - Read Resume Instructions and Execute

**USAGE:**
- `/claude-start <project>` - Read instruction file from save command and resume exactly where left off

**Arguments**:
- `<project>` (required): Project name (used to find context file)

**ðŸŽ¯ PURPOSE:**
Read the instruction file created by `/claude-save` or `/claude-save-fast` and follow those exact instructions

**âš¡ SIMPLE WORKFLOW:**
1. **Find instruction file:** `.claude/branch-context/[current-branch]-context.md`
2. **Read instructions:** Load the handoff document
3. **Follow instructions:** Execute exactly what the previous Claude documented
4. **Ask for direction:** Present status and wait for user guidance

**ðŸ“‹ EXECUTION STEPS:**

**Step 1: Navigate to Project**
1. **Change to project directory:** `cd [project]`
2. **Get current branch:** `git branch --show-current`

**Step 2: Find and Read Instructions**
3. **Locate context file:** `.claude/branch-context/[branch-name]-context.md`
4. **Read instruction file:** Load the complete handoff document
5. **Parse instructions:** Extract setup steps, current state, todos, next actions

**Step 3: Execute Setup Instructions**
6. **Follow IMMEDIATE SETUP section:** Execute each command listed
7. **Verify expected state:** Confirm git status, processes, etc. match expectations
8. **Restore TodoWrite:** Set up todos exactly as documented in instruction file

**Step 4: Present Status and Wait**
9. **Show resume summary:** Display what was restored and current state
10. **Present next actions:** Show the priority actions from instruction file
11. **Ask for direction:** "I've restored your session. Which task should I work on first?"

**ðŸŽ¯ KEY PRINCIPLES:**
- **Follow the instructions exactly** as written in the context file
- **Don't improvise** - the previous Claude documented everything needed
- **Verify state matches expectations** from the instruction file
- **Ask user for guidance** after restoring the session

**ðŸ“„ INSTRUCTION FILE FORMAT:**
The context file contains everything needed to resume:
```markdown
# Resume Instructions for Claude

## IMMEDIATE SETUP
[Exact commands to run]

## WHAT YOU WERE WORKING ON
[Task description]

## CURRENT STATE
[File states, processes, last command]

## TODO LIST STATE
[TodoWrite items with status]

## NEXT ACTIONS (PRIORITY ORDER)
[Exact next steps]

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS
[How to check everything works]
```

**ðŸ”„ EXPECTED WORKFLOW:**
1. Previous session: `/claude-save <project>` â†’ Shows path to instruction file
2. Current session: `/claude-start <project>` â†’ Reads instruction file and follows it
3. Result: **Perfect resume** exactly where previous Claude left off

**âœ… SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- Context file found and read successfully
- All setup commands executed as instructed
- TodoWrite restored to exact previous state
- User presented with next actions and asked for direction
- **Zero information loss** between sessions

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: NO AUTOMATIC ACTIONS**
- **READ ONLY**: Follow instructions but don't execute work automatically
- **VERIFY FIRST**: Confirm the expected state matches reality
- **ASK USER**: Always ask which task to work on after restoring session
- **NO IMPROVISATION**: Stick to exactly what's in the instruction file
