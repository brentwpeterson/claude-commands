# /claude-debug

**Purpose**: Launch structured debug session with regression tracking to prevent circular debugging.

**Usage**: `/claude-debug <project> [issue-description]`

**Arguments**:
- `<project>` (required): Project to debug - any Git repository in your workspace (per `.claude/local/workspace.env` configuration)
- `[issue-description]` (optional): Brief description of the issue being debugged

**AUTOMATIC ATTEMPT NUMBERING**: Command automatically detects next attempt number - you don't track it manually.

## Command Behavior

When executed, Claude will:

1. **Clean task directory** - Check for scattered debug files and consolidate them
2. **Find or create debug log** `[branch-name]-debug.log` in current task folder
3. **Automatically determine next attempt number** by reading existing attempts
4. **Add new attempt to summary section** and detailed log
5. **No manual tracking required** - system handles attempt numbering
6. **Maintain ONE organized debug file** - no scattered files allowed

## Implementation Instructions for Claude

### ON COMMAND EXECUTION:

#### Step 1: Clean Directory and Determine Debug Log File Location

**FIRST: Check for scattered debug files in task directory**
```bash
# Look for scattered debug files that should be consolidated
find [project]/todo/current/[category]/[task-name]/ -maxdepth 1 -name "*debug*" -o -name "*test*" -o -name "*attempt*" -o -name "*log*" -o -name "*analysis*" -o -name "*failure*" | grep -v ".log$"
```

**If scattered files found:**
1. **List all files found**: Show user what scattered files exist
2. **Ask for consolidation**: "Found X scattered debug files. Consolidate into main debug log? [Y/n]"
3. **If Yes**: Read each file, extract relevant information, add to debug log with timestamps
4. **Move to archive**: Move consolidated files to `archive/` subdirectory
5. **Report cleanup**: "Consolidated X files into debug log, moved to archive/"

**THEN: Set debug log location**
```bash
# Get current branch name
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
# Convert to safe filename: feature/my-branch ‚Üí feature-my-branch
SAFE_BRANCH=$(echo $BRANCH | sed 's/\//-/g')
# Debug LOG file location - THE ONLY debug file that should exist
DEBUG_FILE="[project]/todo/current/[category]/[task-name]/${SAFE_BRANCH}-debug.log"
```

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- ‚úÖ **ONE debug log file ONLY** per task/branch
- ‚ùå **NO scattered debug files** in task directory
- ‚úÖ **Archive folder** for consolidated old files
- ‚úÖ **Clean directory** maintained automatically

#### Step 2: Create or Update Debug Log

**If debug log file EXISTS:**
- Load existing `[branch-name]-debug.log`
- **AUTOMATICALLY find the highest attempt number** in the SUMMARY section
- **AUTOMATICALLY increment by 1** for the new attempt
- Example: If log shows attempts #1-#26, new attempt = #27
- Add to both summary header AND detailed log sections

**If debug log file DOES NOT EXIST:**
- Create new `[branch-name]-debug.log` with this EXACT structure:

```
##############################################################################
# TEST ATTEMPT LOG - [FEATURE/ISSUE NAME]
##############################################################################
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
# - Each test attempt = one attempt number
# - Format: Attempt #X | Date Time | What tested | Result | What was tried/learned
# - Add new attempts to BOTH summary and detailed log below
# - "FAILED" = didn't work, "SUCCESS" = worked as expected, "PENDING" = ready to test
##############################################################################
# SUMMARY OF ATTEMPTS:
# Attempt #1  | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | [what tested] | PENDING | [description of what will be tried]
##############################################################################
# DETAILED LOG ENTRIES:
##############################################################################
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **ALWAYS update BOTH the summary header AND add detailed entry**
2. **Use sequential attempt numbers** (don't skip numbers)
3. **Include timestamp, what was tested, result, and learning**
4. **Keep summary lines short** (one line per attempt)
5. **Add detailed entries below** with full debugging information

#### Step 3: MANDATORY Pre-Debug Checks

**BEFORE ANY DEBUGGING:**
```markdown
## üîç PRE-DEBUG VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### A. What Was Working Before?
- [ ] List features that were confirmed working
- [ ] Note last known good state/commit
- [ ] Document any recent changes

### B. Current State Check
- [ ] Run smoke tests to establish baseline
- [ ] Verify containers are running
- [ ] Check if issue reproduces consistently

### C. Regression Check
- [ ] Review Section 13.C (Regression Log) for similar issues
- [ ] Check if this was previously fixed
- [ ] Note if this is a regression
```

#### Step 4: Structured Experiment Tracking

**For EVERY test/experiment:**
```markdown
| ID    | Time  | Hypothesis | Action/Change | Env | Result | Evidence | Next Step |
|-------|-------|------------|---------------|-----|--------|----------|-----------|
| E-XXX | HH:MM | [What you think is wrong] | [Exact commands run] | dev | ‚úÖ/‚ùå | [Actual output] | [What to try next] |
```

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Never repeat an experiment ID
- Always show actual command output
- Mark results as ‚úÖ (worked) or ‚ùå (failed)
- Include error messages verbatim

#### Step 5: Anti-Circle Pattern

**After EVERY 3 experiments:**
```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è CIRCLE CHECK

**Have we tested this before?** [Check experiment log]
**Are we making progress?** [Compare to initial hypothesis]
**Should we pivot?** [Consider different approach]

If circling detected:
1. STOP current approach
2. Review all experiments
3. Form NEW hypothesis not yet tested
4. Consider asking user for guidance
```

#### Step 6: Regression Tracking

**When issue is FIXED:**
```markdown
## ‚úÖ RESOLUTION LOG

**Root Cause**: [Specific technical cause]
**Fix Applied**: [Exact changes made]
**Verification**: [How we confirmed it works]
**Regression Risk**: [What could break this again]

Add to Section 13.C Regression Log:
| Date | Area | Issue | Fix | Test Added |
```

### COMMAND OUTPUT FORMAT:

```markdown
üîç DEBUG LOG: [Created/Updated]
üìÅ Log File: [project]/todo/current/.../[branch-name]-debug.log
üéØ Current Attempt: #X
üìä Previous Attempts: [FAILED/SUCCESS count]
üîÑ Last Result: [Brief status]

## Attempt #X Ready
**Testing**: [what will be tested]
**Hypothesis**: [what we think will happen]
**Expected Result**: [SUCCESS/FAILED and why]

## Summary Added To Log:
Attempt #X | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | [test case] | PENDING | [description]

Ready to execute attempt? [Y/n/modify]
```

### SPECIAL FLAGS:

- `/claude-debug --continue`: Resume existing session
- `/claude-debug --status`: Show current debug status only
- `/claude-debug --experiments`: List all experiments with results
- `/claude-debug --regression`: Check if this is a known regression
- `/claude-debug --close`: Finalize session with resolution

### INTEGRATION WITH OTHER COMMANDS:

- Automatically called by `/claude-start` if debug session exists
- Links to `/claude-violation-log` for process violations
- Updates `/zsolutely.md` principles during debugging

### EXAMPLE SESSION:

```bash
User: /claude-debug User can't login after email verification

Claude:
üîç DEBUG LOG: Updated
üìÅ Log File: [project]/todo/current/feature/existing-user-team-addition/feature-existing-user-team-addition-debug.log
üéØ Current Attempt: #28 (automatically detected)
üìä Previous Attempts: 26 FAILED, 1 SUCCESS
üîÑ Last Result: Attempt #27 PENDING - Root cause fix deployed

## Attempt #28 Ready
**Testing**: Login attempt for newuser_1757699240 after email verification
**Hypothesis**: Email verification not updating user login capability
**Expected Result**: SUCCESS - user should be able to login after verification

## Summary Added To Log:
Attempt #28 | 2025-09-14 16:15 | newuser_1757699240 login | PENDING | Test login after email verification fix

Ready to execute attempt #28? [Y/n/modify]
```

**Key Features Shown:**
- ‚úÖ **Automatic attempt numbering** (found #27 in log, created #28)
- ‚úÖ **No manual tracking** required from user
- ‚úÖ **Previous attempts counted** automatically
- ‚úÖ **Clear next attempt prepared** with summary added to log

### SUCCESS CRITERIA:

1. **No repeated experiments** - Each test has unique ID
2. **Clear progression** - Can see what led to solution
3. **Regression prevention** - Issues don't resurface
4. **Time efficiency** - Avoid circular debugging
5. **Knowledge preservation** - Debug learnings persist

### FAILURE PATTERNS TO PREVENT:

‚ùå Testing the same thing multiple times
‚ùå Not recording actual outputs
‚ùå Assuming without verifying
‚ùå Losing track of what was tested
‚ùå Forgetting previous fixes

‚úÖ Structured, trackable experiments
‚úÖ Evidence-based conclusions
‚úÖ Clear progression toward solution
‚úÖ Preserved debugging knowledge
‚úÖ Regression awareness

This command ensures debugging sessions are efficient, trackable, and never repeat the same mistakes.
