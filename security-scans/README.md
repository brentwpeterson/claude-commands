# Security Scans Directory

This directory contains security scan reports generated by Claude during development sessions.

## Purpose
- Automated security scans of codebases for sensitive information
- Session-end security reviews and recommendations
- Track security improvements over time
- Maintain security compliance documentation

## File Types
- `security-session-end-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md` - End-of-session security reports
- `security-clean-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md` - Security cleanup verification reports

## Report Contents
Security scan reports typically include:
- Critical issues found (API keys, credentials, etc.)
- Security warnings and recommendations
- Security score and improvements
- File-by-file security analysis
- Remediation suggestions

## Usage
These reports help:
- Identify accidental credential commits
- Monitor security posture over time
- Ensure clean codebases before deployment
- Document security practices

## Privacy Considerations
When sharing publicly, sanitize reports to remove:
- Actual file paths and directory structures
- Real project names and sensitive identifiers
- Specific infrastructure details
- Any discovered credentials (even if false positives)
