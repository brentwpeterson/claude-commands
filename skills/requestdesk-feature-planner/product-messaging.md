## Content Performance & Analytics

**What we have now:**
- Google Search Console integrated directly in the app
- Users see impressions, clicks, and ranking positions for their content
- We use GSC data to find opportunities: questions people are asking, searches where content ranks on page 100
- This helps clients understand what content could be improved to perform better
- Leading indicators for AEO (answer engine optimization), SEO, and AIO (AI optimization)
- These score content before it even ranks so you know if you're pointed in the right direction

**What's coming:**
- GA4 integration for the full traffic picture

**WordPress Extension:**
- Includes all of the above (GSC, AEO/SEO/AIO scoring) minus GA4 for now

**How to position this:**
- We don't just create content. We help you understand what's working and find opportunities to improve.
- GSC integration means we can find the gaps. What are people searching for that you're barely ranking for? That's your next article.
- Leading indicators (AEO/SEO/AIO) mean you don't have to wait 3 months to know if content will perform.
