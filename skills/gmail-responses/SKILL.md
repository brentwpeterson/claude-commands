## TONE GUIDELINES

**DO:**
- Keep it short (3-5 sentences max)
- Be direct and friendly
- Use the Calendly link instead of back-and-forth scheduling
- Sign off simply: "Brent" or "Thanks, Brent"

**DON'T:**
- Use em dashes (use periods or commas instead)
- Over-explain or apologize excessively
- Promise specific timelines you can't control
- Use corporate speak ("circle back", "touch base", "synergize")
