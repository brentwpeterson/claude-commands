## Signal Hierarchy (Strongest to Weakest)

| Rank | Signal | What It Means |
|------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | **Reply** | Active interest, conversation started |
| 2 | **Meeting booked** | High intent, ready to evaluate |
| 3 | **Multiple clicks same email** | Deep interest, exploring options |
| 4 | **Click on CTA** | Interest in offer/demo |
| 5 | **Multiple opens** | Considering, may be sharing internally |
| 6 | **Single open** | Aware, minimal signal |
| 7 | **No open** | Missed, filtered, or ignoring |

## Email Engagement Interpretation

### Click Patterns

| Pattern | Interpretation | Recommended Action |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **8+ clicks** | Very high interest, exploring thoroughly | Follow up within 24-48 hrs, reference specific content |
| **3-7 clicks** | Strong interest, comparing options | Follow up within 3-5 days, offer demo |
| **1-2 clicks** | Curious but not committed | Continue sequence, try different angle |
| **0 clicks, opened** | Read but not compelled | Test different value prop or CTA |
| **0 opens** | Didn't see or ignored | Try different subject line, channel, or timing |

### Open Patterns

| Pattern | Interpretation | Recommended Action |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Multiple opens, same day** | Actively evaluating, possibly sharing | High priority follow-up |
| **Opens days apart** | Coming back to it, slow evaluation | Patient follow-up, provide more info |
| **Single open, no click** | Skimmed, not hooked | Stronger hook needed |
| **Forwarded (if visible)** | Sharing with decision makers | Multi-thread the account |

### Timing Signals

| Pattern | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Opened within 1 hour** | Email timing is good for this contact |
| **Opened at odd hours** | Note their timezone/schedule |
| **Weekend opens** | May be a founder/owner (always working) |
| **Consistent open time** | Schedule sends for that window |

---

## Engagement Velocity

**Definition:** How quickly engagement happens after send.

| Velocity | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| **< 1 hour** | High priority inbox, or topic hit nerve |
| **Same day** | Normal engagement, interested |
| **2-3 days** | Busy, but got to it |
| **1 week+** | Low priority for them, or just saw it |

**Fast velocity + high clicks = hot lead. Act fast.**

---

## Sequence Position Context

Engagement means different things depending on sequence stage:

| Stage | High Engagement Means | Low Engagement Means |
|-------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Email 1** | Topic resonates, good targeting | Normal, most don't engage E1 |
| **Email 2-3** | Warming up, keep going | Try different angle |
| **Email 4-5** | Persistent interest despite no reply | Consider different channel |
| **Breakup email** | May respond to scarcity/finality | Likely not a fit right now |

---

## Multi-Channel Signals

### Email + LinkedIn Correlation

| Email Behavior | LinkedIn Behavior | Interpretation |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Opens, no reply | Viewed profile | Checking you out, warm |
| No opens | Accepted connection | Prefers LinkedIn |
| Clicked demo link | Liked your post | Building trust, not ready to talk |
| No engagement | No LinkedIn activity | Wrong contact or bad timing |

### LinkedIn-Specific Signals

| Signal | Strength | Meaning |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Accepted connection + messaged** | Very High | Wants to engage |
| **Accepted connection, no message** | Medium | Open but passive |
| **Viewed profile multiple times** | Medium-High | Researching you |
| **Liked/commented on post** | Medium | Aware, building familiarity |
| **No response to connection** | Low | Not interested or not active |

---

## Negative Signals (Watch For)

| Signal | What It Means | Action |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Unsubscribed** | Done with email | LinkedIn only, if at all |
| **Marked as spam** | Aggressive, back off | Remove from all outreach |
| **Bounced email** | Bad data | Find correct email or remove |
| **"Not interested" reply** | Clear no | Respect it, remove from sequence |
| **"Bad timing" reply** | No right now | Schedule future follow-up (3-6 months) |
| **Ghosted after meeting** | Lost interest or internal blocker | Try different stakeholder |

---

## Engagement Decay

**Engagement fades. Act while it's fresh.**

| Time Since Engagement | Status | Action |
|----------------------|--------|--------|
| **0-48 hours** | Hot | Immediate follow-up |
| **3-7 days** | Warm | Follow-up with new value |
| **1-2 weeks** | Cooling | Re-engage with different angle |
| **2-4 weeks** | Cold | Reset, try new approach |
| **1+ month** | Stale | Back to nurture or new sequence |

## Writing Insights to Notes

When documenting engagement signals, include:

```
Engagement Analysis ([DATE]):

Email: "[Subject line]"
Sent: [date]
Opens: [X]
Clicks: [X] (links clicked: [which ones])
Velocity: [time from send to first open]

Signal Strength: [High/Medium/Low]
Interpretation: [what this means]
Recommended Action: [specific next step]
Timeline: [when to act]
```

**Example:**
```
Engagement Analysis (2026-01-23):

Email: "Is your Shopify store visible to AI search?"
Sent: Jan 12, 2026
Opens: 2
Clicks: 8 (demo link clicked 3x, blog link clicked 5x)
Velocity: 1 hour

Signal Strength: HIGH
Interpretation: Very interested in AI search topic. Explored
both demo and educational content. Multiple demo link clicks
without booking suggests wants more info or has objection.

Recommended Action: Personal follow-up referencing the AI
search content. Offer quick 15-min focused call. Address
potential objections (time, complexity, cost).

Timeline: Within 48 hours (engagement was 11 days ago - act now)
```
