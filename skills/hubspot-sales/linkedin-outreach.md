# LinkedIn Outreach Workflow

**Purpose:** Multi-channel strategy using LinkedIn alongside email.

---

## When to Use LinkedIn

### Primary Channel When:
- Email has no opens after full sequence
- Contact has "No More Emails" status
- Contact is very active on LinkedIn (posts regularly)
- Direct connection exists
- Mutual connections provide warm intro path

### Secondary Channel When:
- Email gets opens but no clicks/replies
- High-value contact worth extra effort
- Building relationship before sales conversation
- Post-meeting nurture

### Skip LinkedIn When:
- Contact has no LinkedIn presence
- Contact hasn't been active in 6+ months
- Already in active email conversation
- Low-fit contact (not worth the time)

## LinkedIn Outreach Sequence

### Step 1: Research (Before Connection)
- Profile headline and current role
- Tenure at company
- Previous relevant experience
- Recent posts or engagement
- Mutual connections
- Content they engage with

**Document in HubSpot Notes:**
```
LinkedIn Research (YYYY-MM-DD):
- Role: [Title] at [Company] for [X months/years]
- Previous: [Relevant past role]
- Active: [Yes/No - last post date]
- Mutual connections: [Names if relevant]
- Content focus: [What they post/engage with]
```

### Step 2: Connection Request
**Timing:** After 1-2 emails sent (not before any outreach).

**DO:**
- Keep it short (LinkedIn truncates)
- Reference something specific
- No pitch in connection request

**DON'T:**
- Send blank connection request
- Pitch in the connection note
- Be generic ("I'd like to add you to my network")

**Template:**
```
Hi [Name] - I've been reaching out about AI-powered content
for Shopify stores. Thought I'd connect here too. No pitch,
just wanted to be in your network.
```

**Or even simpler:**
```
Hi [Name] - came across [Company] while researching
[industry/topic]. Would love to connect.
```

### Step 3: Post-Connection Message
**Timing:** 2-3 days after connection accepted (not immediately).

**DO:**
- Thank them for connecting
- Add value (insight, article, observation)
- Soft CTA or no CTA

**DON'T:**
- Immediately pitch
- Send wall of text
- Sound like automated outreach

**Template:**
```
Thanks for connecting, [Name]. I saw [Company] is doing
[something specific]. We're seeing a lot of Shopify stores
use AI for product content - thought this might be relevant:
[link or observation]

No pitch intended - just sharing what's working.
```

### Step 4: Engagement Before Pitch
**Timing:** 1-2 weeks of light engagement.

**Actions:**
- Like 2-3 of their posts (if they post)
- Comment meaningfully on one post (not just "Great post!")
- Share relevant content they might find useful

**Goal:** Get on their radar through value, not pitch.

### Step 5: Direct Message (After Rapport)
**Timing:** After steps above, or if they've engaged with your content.

**DO:**
- Reference previous interaction/engagement
- Be direct about why you're reaching out
- Offer easy next step

**DON'T:**
- Send LinkedIn InMail essay
- Pitch without context
- Ignore previous email outreach

**Template:**
```
[Name], quick question - I've sent a couple emails about
AI content for [Company]. Not sure if they landed or got
buried. Is this something on your radar at all?

Happy to do a quick 15-min call or just share some examples
if that's easier.
```

## LinkedIn Message Types

### Connection Request Note
- Max 300 characters
- No pitch
- Specific reference or mutual connection

### Direct Message (Existing Connection)
- Can be longer but keep under 500 characters
- Conversational tone
- Clear ask or question

### InMail (No Connection)
- Use sparingly (limited credits)
- Reserve for high-value contacts
- Same rules as DM

## LinkedIn Content Engagement Strategy

### Brent's LinkedIn Presence
- Posts regularly (Tuesdays with Claude content)
- Has following in e-commerce space
- Content = trust building

### How to Leverage:
1. Tag relevant contacts in valuable posts (sparingly)
2. Share content prospects might find useful
3. Engage with prospect's content authentically
4. Use shared content as conversation starter

### Example:
```
I posted something about AI search for e-commerce this week
that might be relevant given what [Company] is doing. Thought
you might find it interesting: [link]
```

## LinkedIn + Email Coordination

### Parallel Approach (High-Value Contacts):
| Week | Email | LinkedIn |
|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Email 1 sent | Connection request |
| 2 | Email 2 sent | (Wait for accept) |
| 3 | Email 3 sent | Post-connection message |
| 4 | Email 4 sent | Engage with content |
| 5 | Final email | Direct pitch message |

### Sequential Approach (Email Silent):
| Week | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1-3 | Email sequence runs (no engagement) |
| 4 | Connection request |
| 5 | Post-connection value add |
| 6 | LinkedIn pitch if still silent |

---

## LinkedIn Signals to Watch

### Positive Signals:
| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Quick connection accept | Open to networking |
| Replied to message | Engaged |
| Viewed your profile | Curious |
| Liked your post | Aware of you |
| Commented on your content | High engagement |

### Negative Signals:
| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Ignored connection request | Not interested or inactive |
| Viewed but didn't accept | Maybe, or skeptical |
| Left message on "seen" | Not interested |
| Removed connection | Back off |

---

## Document LinkedIn Activity

**In HubSpot Notes:**
```
LinkedIn Activity (YYYY-MM-DD):

- Connection request sent: [date]
- Connection accepted: [date] / pending / declined
- Messages sent: [count]
- Response: [Yes/No - summary if yes]
- Profile views: [if known]
- Content engagement: [any likes/comments]

Status: [Connected / Pending / Not Connected]
Next action: [What to do next]
```

---

## LinkedIn Templates by Scenario

### After Email Silence
```
Hi [Name] - I've emailed a few times about AI content for
Shopify stores. Not sure if those landed in spam or just
bad timing. Either way, happy to connect here.
```

### After They Viewed Profile
```
I noticed you checked out my profile - was it something
I emailed about? Happy to chat if [topic] is on your radar.
```

### Mutual Connection Exists
```
Hi [Name] - I see we both know [Mutual Connection]. I work
with Shopify stores on AI-powered content. Would love to
connect - always good to know others in the space.
```

### Breakup (Final Touch)
```
Last note - I'll stop filling your inbox. If AI content
for [Company] becomes a priority, I'm easy to find here.
Good luck with everything.
```

## Multi-Threading via LinkedIn

When one contact goes silent, use LinkedIn to find others at company:

1. Search company on LinkedIn
2. Find other relevant titles (VP Marketing, E-commerce Manager)
3. Connect with soft note referencing company, not the silent contact
4. Create new HubSpot contact if they engage

**Note in HubSpot:**
```
Multi-thread (YYYY-MM-DD):
- Original contact [Name] unresponsive
- Found [New Name], [Title] via LinkedIn
- Connection request sent
```
