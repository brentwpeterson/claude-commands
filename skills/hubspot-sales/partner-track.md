# Partner/Agency Track: Detailed Playbook

**Purpose:** Managing relationships with agencies, consultants, and tech partners who can refer e-commerce clients.

---

## Why Partners Are Different

| Direct Prospect | Partner/Agency |
|-----------------|----------------|
| They BUY your service | They REFER clients to you |
| Short sales cycle goal | Long relationship goal |
| Pitch the product | Pitch the partnership |
| ROI for them | ROI for their clients |
| One deal | Multiple deals over time |

**Key Insight:** Pushing too hard turns partners off. This is relationship-first, sales-second.

## Outreach Approach

### Initial Contact (Cold)

**DON'T:**
- Pitch your product
- Ask for referrals immediately
- Sound like a vendor

**DO:**
- Reference something specific about their work
- Offer an insight or connection
- Be peer-to-peer, not sales-to-prospect

**Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

Came across [Agency] while researching [industry/platform] shops.
I run Content Cucumber - we do AI-powered content for e-commerce.

Not pitching anything - just always looking to know good agencies
in the space. If you ever want to swap notes on what's working
for e-commerce content, happy to chat.

[Brent]
```

### Follow-Up (No Response)

**Timing:** 2-3 weeks after initial

**Approach:** Add value, don't push

**Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

Quick thought - saw [something relevant to their business].
Thought of you given [Agency]'s focus on [area].

[Link or insight]

No response needed - just sharing what I'm seeing.

[Brent]
```

### After Connection Made

**Timing:** After they respond or accept LinkedIn

**Approach:** Learn about them, find common ground

**Template:**
```
Thanks for connecting. I'd love to learn more about what
[Agency] is focused on these days. Are you seeing more
demand in any particular area?

Always curious what agencies are hearing from clients.
```

## Monthly Touch Cadence

**Goal:** Stay on radar without being annoying.

**Week 1-2:** Identify one thing of value to share
- Industry insight
- Relevant article (yours or others)
- Introduction to someone they should know
- Congratulations on a win they had

**Week 3-4:** Send the touch

**Types of Monthly Touches:**

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Content share | "Thought this article on [topic] was relevant to your clients" |
| Industry insight | "Seeing a lot of Shopify stores asking about [trend] - you too?" |
| Congratulations | "Saw [Agency] won [award/client]. Nice work." |
| Introduction | "You should meet [Person] - they do [relevant thing]" |
| Event invite | "Speaking at [event] - would be great to see you there" |

**What NOT to send monthly:**
- "Just checking in"
- Product updates (unless they asked)
- Sales pitches
- Generic newsletters

---

## Quarterly Check-In

**Goal:** Deeper conversation, understand their current situation.

**Format:** 15-30 min call or coffee if local

**Agenda:**
1. How's business? What are you focused on?
2. What are you hearing from clients?
3. Any challenges we might help with?
4. (If appropriate) Here's what we've been up to
5. Anything I can do to help you?

**After the call:**
- Send thank you note
- Follow up on any commitments
- Document insights in HubSpot Notes
- Set next quarterly reminder

---

## Making the Ask (When Ready)

**Timing:** Only after relationship is established (3-6 months minimum)

**Signals they're ready:**
- They ask about what you do
- They mention a client with content needs
- They're looking for solutions to recommend
- They've engaged with your content

**How to ask:**

**Soft ask:**
```
If you ever have a client struggling with content, happy to
chat with them. No pressure to recommend us - just offering
if it'd be helpful.
```

**Direct ask (stronger relationship):**
```
I know you work with a lot of [type] brands. We've been
getting good results for similar stores. Would you be open
to referring clients who need content help? Happy to discuss
how we'd make it worth your while.
```

## Case Study: Jason Young / Ballistic Agency

**Background:**
- Jason owns Ballistic Agency
- Already did case studies for Shopware through his agency
- He's a PARTNER, not a direct customer

**Goal:**
- Long-term relationship
- Get him to bring us more Shopware (or other) clients for case studies
- Eventually expand beyond case studies to content services

**Current Status:** Relationship exists, needs nurturing

**Recommended Track:**
1. Move to Partner/Agency campaign
2. Monthly value touch (not sales)
3. Quarterly check-in call
4. When he mentions a client need → soft offer
5. Long game - this could be multiple deals over years

**Immediate Action:**
- Update HubSpot: Lead Status → "Partner Prospect" or similar
- Add note documenting partner profile
- Set monthly touch reminder
- Do NOT put in direct sales sequence
