# CC's HubSpot Service Offerings

Detailed descriptions of Content Cucumber's four HubSpot partner services.

---

## Service 1: CMS Website Build & Migration

### What CC Does
- Migrate existing websites (WordPress, Squarespace, custom) to HubSpot CMS
- Build new websites on HubSpot CMS from scratch
- Create custom HubSpot themes and modules
- Set up blog, landing pages, and content structure
- Configure smart content rules for personalization
- Implement SEO best practices and redirects

### The CC Difference
Other HubSpot partners build the site and hand it off. CC builds the site AND creates the content that goes on it. No more "beautiful new website with placeholder text for 6 months."

### Target Buyer
- Companies currently on WordPress or legacy platforms
- Frustrated with plugin maintenance, security patches, hosting management
- Want their website tightly integrated with their CRM
- Marketing teams that want to edit pages without calling a developer

### Process
1. **Discovery** - Audit current site, map content, identify gaps
2. **Design** - Create HubSpot theme matching brand (or adapt existing)
3. **Migration** - Move content, set up redirects, preserve SEO equity
4. **Content** - Write/rewrite page content for the new platform
5. **Launch** - QA, performance testing, go-live support

### Pricing Context
`[NEED: Is this project-based pricing? Monthly retainer? Range?]`

## Service 2: Content Creation for HubSpot

### What CC Does
- Blog posts optimized for HubSpot's topic cluster strategy
- Landing page copy that converts
- Email campaigns (nurture sequences, newsletters, announcements)
- Pillar pages and supporting content
- Social media content tied to HubSpot campaigns

### The CC Difference
CC writes content specifically designed for HubSpot's content tools. Topic clusters aren't an afterthought. They're the starting point. Every blog post maps to a pillar page. Every email ties to a workflow. The content strategy lives inside HubSpot, not in a separate spreadsheet.

### Target Buyer
- HubSpot users who have the tools but no content to fill them
- Marketing teams stretched thin on content production
- Companies that tried AI content and found it doesn't perform
- Businesses that need consistent, quality content every week

### Content Types & Delivery
| Content Type | Typical Cadence | Where It Lives in HubSpot |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Blog posts | 2-4/week | Blog tool, topic clusters |
| Landing pages | As needed | Landing page builder |
| Email campaigns | 1-2/week | Marketing email tool |
| Pillar pages | 1/quarter | Website pages |
| Social posts | 3-5/week | Social tool or manual |

## Service 3: Implementation & Setup

### Sales Hub Pro Implementation

**The problem CC solves:** Companies pay $1,600+/month for Sales Hub Professional but use it like a $20/month Starter plan. Sequences have generic templates. Playbooks don't exist. One pipeline handles everything. Forecasting is a guess.

**What CC implements:**
- **Pipeline architecture** - Separate pipelines for new business, upsell, renewal (as needed)
- **Deal stages** - Custom stages with required properties and automation triggers
- **Sequences** - Real, personalized email sequences (written by CC writers, not templates)
- **Playbooks** - Discovery call scripts, demo guides, objection handling docs
- **Quotes & e-signatures** - Professional proposal workflow
- **Forecasting** - Weighted pipeline, manual + AI predictions, team accountability
- **Custom reporting** - Dashboards that answer real business questions

### Marketing Hub Pro Implementation

**The problem CC solves:** Marketing Hub Pro has powerful automation, but most teams only use basic email sends. Workflows are unused. Lead scoring is not configured. The SEO tool sits empty.

**What CC implements:**
- **Workflow automation** - Lead nurture, re-engagement, internal notifications, data cleanup
- **Lead scoring** - Property-based + behavioral scoring rules that make MQL/SQL meaningful
- **Topic clusters** - Content strategy mapped in HubSpot's SEO tool
- **Campaign structure** - Assets grouped into campaigns with attribution tracking
- **Email templates** - Branded, tested, mobile-responsive templates
- **Forms & CTAs** - Conversion points throughout the site with smart rules
- **Reporting dashboards** - Marketing performance visibility for the whole team

### The CC Difference for Implementation
Most HubSpot partners configure the tools and walk away. CC configures the tools AND fills them with content. Sequences get real emails. Playbooks get real scripts. Workflows get real nurture content. The system works from day one, not "once you write the content."

## Service 4: HubSpot Audit & Optimization

### What the Audit Covers
1. **Portal health** - Data quality, duplicate contacts, unused properties
2. **Tool utilization** - Which Pro/Enterprise features are actually being used
3. **Automation** - Workflow efficiency, sequence performance, scoring accuracy
4. **Content** - Blog performance, landing page conversion rates, email metrics
5. **Integration** - Connected apps, data flow, sync issues
6. **ROI analysis** - Are you getting value from what you're paying for?

### Deliverables
- Comprehensive audit report (100+ page PDF with screenshots)
- Priority-ranked recommendations
- Quick wins list (things fixable in under an hour)
- Strategic roadmap (30/60/90 day plan)
- Executive summary for leadership

### Existing Asset
CC has an 11-page slideshow of sample audit report pages. This is already a WordPress block pattern: `cucumber/hubspot-audit-slideshow` (12 WebP images showing dashboard overview and sample report pages).

### Who Needs an Audit
1. **"We're paying a lot but not sure what we're getting"** - ROI uncertainty
2. **"Our data is a mess"** - Duplicates, bad properties, no segmentation
3. **"We set it up 2 years ago and haven't touched it"** - Stale configuration
4. **"We just hired a new marketing person"** - Fresh eyes need a baseline

### Process
1. **Request** - Client fills out brief form or schedules a call
2. **Analysis** - CC audits the portal (typically 1-2 weeks)
3. **Delivery** - Report walkthrough call + written recommendations

### Pricing Context
`[NEED: Is the audit free (lead gen)? Paid? Freemium (basic free, detailed paid)?]`

## Competitive Positioning

### CC vs Typical HubSpot Partner

| Aspect | Typical HubSpot Partner | Content Cucumber |
|--------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Primary service** | Implementation only | Implementation + ongoing content |
| **After setup** | Handoff, maybe quarterly check-ins | Ongoing weekly content delivery |
| **Content approach** | "You provide the content" | CC writes all the content |
| **Sequences/Playbooks** | Configured with placeholder text | Configured with real, tested copy |
| **E-commerce** | Limited experience | Shopify + HubSpot integration specialists |
| **Content model** | Project-based | Subscription (consistent monthly delivery) |
| **Team** | Mostly developers/consultants | Writers + strategists + implementers |

### CC's Unique Value Proposition
"Most HubSpot partners are implementation shops. Most content agencies don't know HubSpot. CC is both. We configure your HubSpot tools and fill them with content that actually works."
