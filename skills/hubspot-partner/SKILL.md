# HubSpot Partner Services - Content Cucumber as HubSpot Solutions Partner

**Skill Description:** Knowledge base for Content Cucumber's HubSpot partner services sold to clients. Covers CC's four service offerings (CMS Build/Migration, Content Creation for HubSpot, Implementation/Setup, Audits & Optimization), HubSpot product knowledge, and content guidelines for HubSpot-related pages.

## CRITICAL DISTINCTION

| Skill | Purpose | Context |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **hubspot-partner** (THIS) | What CC sells to HubSpot customers | Client-facing services |
| **hubspot-sales** | How CC uses HubSpot internally | Sales outreach workflow |

These are completely different contexts. This skill is about CC's expertise as a HubSpot Solutions Partner delivering services to clients. The hubspot-sales skill is about CC's own CRM usage for prospecting.

## When Claude Should Apply This Skill

Apply automatically when:
- Writing content about CC's HubSpot services (pages, blog posts, social)
- Working on contentcucumber.com HubSpot service pages
- Discussing HubSpot CMS, Sales Hub Pro, or Marketing Hub Pro in the context of CC's client offerings
- User mentions "HubSpot partner", "HubSpot services", or "HubSpot audit" in a content context
- Running `/cucumber design` or `/cucumber writer` for HubSpot-related topics
- Creating or editing pages under the `/hubspot/` URL path on contentcucumber.com

Do NOT apply when:
- Working on CC's own HubSpot CRM (use hubspot-sales instead)
- Enriching contacts or writing outreach emails
- Managing HubSpot deals, pipelines, or sequences

## Quick Reference: CC's HubSpot Positioning

**Tagline concept:** "Implementation + Content. Not just setup, not just writing. Both."

**Key differentiators:**
1. CC does both the HubSpot setup AND the content that fills it
2. E-commerce specialists (Shopify + HubSpot integration experience)
3. Human writers + AI-assisted workflow (not pure AI content)
4. Ongoing partnership model, not one-time project dumps

**Proof points:**
- 60,000+ content projects delivered
- 55M+ words written
- 4.9/5 average rating
- `[NEED: HubSpot-specific implementation/migration count]`
- `[NEED: HubSpot certifications held by team]`
