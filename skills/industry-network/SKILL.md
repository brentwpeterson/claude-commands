# Industry Network - eCommerce Professional Directory

**Skill Description:** Maintain a directory of eCommerce industry professionals for LinkedIn mentions, tagging, and relationship tracking. Used by commerce-reporting, create-social, plan-social, and other content skills.

## How to Use This Directory

When writing LinkedIn posts (especially commerce reports), check this directory for:
1. **Relevant experts to mention** based on topic tags
2. **LinkedIn handles** for accurate tagging
3. **Relationship context** so mentions feel natural, not random
4. **Company context** to avoid outdated references

### Mention Rules

- Only mention someone if the post topic aligns with their expertise
- Mention feels natural when Brent has a real relationship or interaction history
- Don't tag more than 2-3 people per post (looks spammy)
- If no relationship exists yet, reference their work instead of tagging ("as [name] has written about...")
- Always use their current company/role, not a previous one

## Adding New Professionals

When Brent mentions a new industry contact or wants to add someone:

1. Add to the appropriate category table
2. Research their LinkedIn URL and current role
3. Set relationship level and context
4. Add relevant topic tags
5. Update the topic-to-expert reference if needed

## When Claude Should Apply This Skill

Apply this skill automatically when:
- Writing LinkedIn posts about eCommerce industry topics (commerce reports)
- User mentions wanting to tag or mention industry peers
- Creating content that could benefit from expert references
- User asks "who should I mention" or "who's relevant for this topic"
- Writing about specific commerce topics listed in the topic reference

Do NOT apply this skill for:
- Non-commerce content (running, EO, personal posts)
- Internal tool/product content
- When the user explicitly says not to mention anyone
