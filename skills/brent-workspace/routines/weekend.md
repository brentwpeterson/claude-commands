# Weekend Routine

**Day Focus:** Optional projects, personal interests, recharge

---

## Weekend Philosophy

**Weekends are for recharging, not grinding.**

If you're here, you CHOSE to work. That's fine. But keep it:
- **Optional** - Nothing is due
- **Interesting** - Work on what excites you
- **Limited** - Set a time limit and stick to it

---

## If You Want to Work

### Option 1: Fun Projects

Things that are interesting but never urgent:
- Experiment with new tools
- Write about something you're curious about
- Build something just for fun
- Organize/clean up technical debt

### Option 2: Light Admin

Low-stakes cleanup:
- Inbox to zero (satisfying, low stress)
- Organize files/notes
- Update documentation
- Process idea backlog

### Option 3: Content Ahead

Get ahead on content (reduces weekday pressure):
- Write extra TWC articles
- Draft newsletter ideas
- Create social media queue
- Record video content

## What NOT to Do

- Sprint work (that's for weekdays)
- Urgent client stuff (it can wait)
- Stressful debugging (Monday problem)
- Anything with a deadline

---

## Morning Checklist (MINIMAL - 15 min max)

Only if you want to. Completely optional.

| # | Task | Time |
|---|------|------|
| 1 | Quick inbox scan | 10 min |
| 2 | Check for fires only | 5 min |

**If there's a fire:** Note it, address Monday unless truly urgent.

---

## Time Limit

**Set a limit before you start:**

- Light day: 1-2 hours max
- Project day: 3-4 hours max
- Never: Full work day

**When timer goes off:** Stop. It will be there Monday.
