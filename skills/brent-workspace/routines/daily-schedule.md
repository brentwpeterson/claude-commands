## Non-Negotiable Daily Punch List

These run every morning regardless of what day it is. Complete before anything else.

1. **Check calendar** - Know what meetings you have today
2. **Clear inbox** - Triage email, archive noise, flag action items
3. **Clear HubSpot tasks** - Process open tasks, close completed ones
4. **Review HubSpot deals** - Check pipeline, flag stale or closing-soon deals
5. **Check sprint board** - Review active sprint items, know today's priorities

After the punch list, load the day-specific routine for content and rock work.
