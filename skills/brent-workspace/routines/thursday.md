```

## Rock Work

Thursday is prime rock work day:

1. Both weekly content pieces are done (TWC Tuesday, Newsletter Wednesday)
2. No major content deadlines
3. Block 4+ hours for deep work on Q1 Rocks

**Recommended:**
- Pick the rock with the most momentum
- Or pick the one that's falling behind
- Single-task focus until meaningful progress

## Sprint Check

**Mid-week sprint pulse:**
- How many points completed so far this week?
- On track for sprint goal?
- Any blockers to surface?

Quick status, not a full review.
