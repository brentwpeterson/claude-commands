## Content Tasks

### 1. LinkedIn Newsletter Publishes Today

**The newsletter should already be scheduled in LinkedIn.**

**Morning check:**
- Verify the newsletter published correctly
- Check for any formatting issues
- Note the subscriber count

### 2. TRIGGER: Schedule 2-Week Promotion Campaign

**When Brent announces "article published" or "newsletter is live":**

1. **Ask for the LinkedIn article URL** (pulse link, not post link)

2. **Read the article from Obsidian:**
   ```
   Brent Notes/LinkedIn Articles/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md
   ```

3. **Run the promotion workflow** per `linkedin-article-promotion.md`:
   - Create 15 posts with varied hooks
   - Schedule across platforms:
     - X: 5 posts (Days 1, 3, 6, 10, 14)
     - Bluesky: 6 posts (Days 1, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14)
     - Threads: 2 posts (Days 1, 7)
     - LinkedIn: 2 reminder posts (Days 7, 14)
   - Vary posting times (9 AM - 2:30 PM EST)

4. **Confirm with summary table** showing all scheduled posts

**Full workflow details:** `.claude/skills/brent-workspace/linkedin-article-promotion.md`

### 3. Monitor Newsletter Engagement

**Throughout the day:**
- Check open rate (LinkedIn analytics)
- Check click-through rates
- Respond to any comments or replies
- Note top-performing sections for future reference

### 4. Start Thinking About Next Week's Newsletter

**Light brainstorming:**
- What topics are trending this week?
- Any client stories worth sharing?
- Industry news to comment on?

**Check the content calendar:**
```
Brent Notes/LinkedIn Articles/README.md
```

Capture ideas in `idea-stash/` folder.
