## Content Tasks

### 1. Write NEXT Tuesday's Tuesdays with Claude Article

**This is the #1 priority for Friday.**

**Why Friday:**
- Fresh mind, no deadline pressure
- Weekend buffer for edits
- No Monday panic

**Process:**
1. Check `idea-stash/` for topic ideas
2. Or pull from quarterly content plan
3. Write full draft (aim for 80%+ complete)
4. Schedule in Medium for Tuesday publication
5. Draft LinkedIn teaser post (schedule Monday)

**Target:** Article DONE by end of Friday, not "in progress"

### 2. Capture Ideas

**End of week brain dump:**
- What came up this week that could be content?
- Client conversations worth writing about?
- Tools or techniques discovered?
- Industry trends observed?

Add to `idea-stash/` folder for future weeks.

## Strety Todos Review (Due Monday)

**Strety todos are due Monday. Review them now so there are no surprises.**

1. Pull open Strety todos:
   ```
   mcp__strety__strety_list_todos
     assignee: "Brent"
     showCompleted: false
   ```
2. For each todo: Is it done? If not, can you finish it today?
3. Flag anything that won't be done by Monday. Tell Brent now, not Monday morning.
