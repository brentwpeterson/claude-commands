# Delegation Rules

## The Team

| Person | Role | Strengths | Best For |
|--------|------|-----------|----------|
| **Susan** | Execution | Following processes, templates | Documented workflows |
| **Vijay** | Lead Finding | Seamless.ai, list building | 1000 leads/day capacity |
| **Writers** | Content | Drafting with clear briefs | Articles, blogs, social |
| **Evrig** | Development | Full-stack dev work | Has credit balance to use |

## Delegation Decision Framework

```
Can someone else do this 100%?
├─ YES → Delegatable = Yes
│   └─ What asset do they need?
│       ├─ Documentation → Create Doc
│       ├─ Example → Create Template
│       ├─ Training → Record Video
│       └─ Nothing → Just assign
└─ NO → Can someone do PART of it?
    ├─ YES → Delegatable = Partial
    │   └─ What part? Document the handoff point
    └─ NO → Delegatable = No (Brent only)
```

## What Can Be Delegated

### To Susan (Execution)
- Following documented processes
- Repetitive tasks with clear templates
- Research with specific criteria
- Data entry / organization
- Email sequences (with templates)

**Requires:** Clear documentation, step-by-step instructions

### To Vijay (Lead Finding)
- Building prospect lists (1000/day capacity)
- Seamless.ai searches
- Company/contact research
- List cleaning and enrichment

**Requires:** Clear ICP criteria, target filters

### To Writers (Content)
- Article first drafts
- Blog post drafts
- Social media post drafts
- Content research

**Requires:** Clear brief with:
- Topic/angle
- Target audience
- Key points to cover
- Tone (use `/brand-brent` or `/brand-cucumber`)
- Examples of good content

### To Evrig (Development)
- Feature implementation
- Bug fixes
- Infrastructure work
- Has credit balance - use it

**Requires:** Clear spec, acceptance criteria

## What Cannot Be Delegated

**Brent Only:**
- Strategy decisions
- Relationship conversations
- Content final approval
- Speaking/presenting
- High-stakes sales calls
- Pricing decisions
- Hiring/firing

## Asset Types

| Asset | When to Use | Effort |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Doc** | Complex process, many steps | High |
| **Video** | Visual process, software walkthrough | Medium |
| **Template** | Repetitive format, fill-in-the-blank | Low |
| **Checklist** | Quality control, don't miss steps | Low |
| **None** | Simple, self-explanatory task | - |

## The 80% Rule

If someone can do it 80% as well as Brent, delegate it.

- Brent's time is the bottleneck
- Good enough > perfect but never done
- Team members improve with practice

## Delegation Blockers

If a task can't be delegated, ask why:
1. **No documentation** → Create the asset
2. **Too complex** → Break into smaller pieces
3. **Trust issue** → Start with low-stakes test
4. **Only Brent knows how** → Document it once, delegate forever
