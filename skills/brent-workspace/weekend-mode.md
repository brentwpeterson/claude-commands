# Weekend Mode

**Trigger:** Saturday or Sunday

## Philosophy

Weekends are for:
- Optional projects (guilt-free)
- Exploration and learning
- Family and rest
- Fun coding if desired

Weekends are NOT for:
- Daily non-negotiables
- Feeling guilty about not working
- Inbox anxiety
- P0 panic (unless true emergency)

## When Activated

If `/brent-start` runs on Saturday or Sunday:

1. **Skip daily non-negotiables** (inbox, HubSpot)
2. **Show weekend greeting:**
   ```
   It's the weekend!

   No inbox. No HubSpot. No guilt.

   Want to work on an optional project, or just relax?
   ```

3. **If Brent wants to work:** Show `WEEKEND-PROJECTS.md`
4. **If Brent wants to relax:** "Great. See you Monday."

## Weekend Projects (From WEEKEND-PROJECTS.md)

These are fun, optional projects with estimates:

| Project | Estimate | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Timer App V1 | 1 weekend | Simple Pomodoro with session tracking |
| Shopify App Docs | 3-4 hours | Document private app installation |
| Gmail OAuth Setup | 2-3 hours | Enable draft email creation |

## Rules

1. **No accountability mode** on weekends
2. **No guilt** if Brent chooses to relax
3. **No carryover** - weekend work is bonus, not expected
4. Projects should be fun or exploratory

## Emergency Override

If there's a true emergency (production down, client crisis):
- Weekend mode deactivates
- Normal priority rules apply
- But this should be RARE

## Idea Capture on Weekends

If Brent has ideas on weekends:
- Capture to `idea-stash/` freely
- No pressure to act on them
- Review on Monday during planning
