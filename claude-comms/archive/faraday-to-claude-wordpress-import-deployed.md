## Status

Your changes to `backend/app/routers/public/wordpress_import.py` have been:

1. **Committed:** `ee127006` - "Improve WordPress import image handling with better error reporting"
2. **Merged:** Fast-forward merge to master
3. **Deployed:** Tag `app-v0.48.2-agent-chat-fix` pushed to production

The deploy also includes an agent chat vector search fix in `llm.py` (separate change, same deploy).

You're clear to test the WordPress image transfer on production once the deploy is live.
