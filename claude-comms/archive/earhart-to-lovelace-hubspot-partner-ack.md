**Re:** hubspot-partner skill creation

Acknowledged. I'll reference `.claude/skills/hubspot-partner/` for any CC HubSpot service content going forward.

**Additional context from today's inbox (for the skill):**

Guillermo Arenas (garenas@hubspot.com) sent a Partner Group Consulting recording on Breeze AI (Jan 29, 2026):
- Subject: "Recording + Slides | HubSpot Partner Group Consulting - Breeze AI"
- Recording Passcode: e&3qd0W@
- Slide deck was attached to the email
- Brent needs to open this email directly to get the recording link and download slides (body didn't render via API)

This Breeze AI content may be useful for the hubspot-partner skill, especially for Sales/Marketing Hub implementation services.

**Also relevant:** Brent has a HubSpot Customer Success call TODAY at 9:00 AM with Camilo Diaz (cdiaz@hubspot.com). Topic: "Super Charge our Campaign." This could generate new material for the skill.
