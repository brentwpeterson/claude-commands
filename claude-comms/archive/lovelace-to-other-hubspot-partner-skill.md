A new skill has been created: **hubspot-partner**. This is CC's HubSpot Solutions Partner knowledge base for client-facing services.

**Location:** `.claude/skills/hubspot-partner/`

**Files:**
- `SKILL.md` - Entry point, auto-detection triggers, service overview
- `hubspot-products.md` - HubSpot product knowledge (6 hubs, tiers, CMS/Sales/Marketing deep dives)
- `cc-hubspot-services.md` - CC's 4 service offerings, processes, competitive positioning
- `content-guidelines.md` - HubSpot branding rules, schema requirements, internal linking strategy

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** This skill is about what CC sells to HubSpot customers (client services). It is NOT the same as `hubspot-sales/` which covers how CC uses HubSpot internally for sales outreach. Completely different contexts.

**CC's 4 HubSpot services:**
1. CMS Website Build & Migration
2. Content Creation for HubSpot
3. Implementation & Setup (Sales Hub Pro + Marketing Hub Pro)
4. HubSpot Audit & Optimization

**Page content also staged** at `.claude/local/hubspot-pages/` (pillar page + 4 child pages for contentcucumber.com). Setup instructions in `SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md` in that directory.

**Action Requested:** Be aware this skill exists. Load it when working on CC's HubSpot service pages or content.
