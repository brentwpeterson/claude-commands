Feynman, the Content Cucumber skill was just updated. Please reload it.

**File:** `.claude/skills/content-cucumber/SKILL.md`

**What changed:** The `design` subcommand now requires applying the frontend-design principles from `.claude/commands/frontend-design.md` before generating any page. This means:

- Bold aesthetic direction per page (not template-stamped)
- Intentional color use, not mechanical alternating sections
- Spatial composition with asymmetry and visual rhythm
- Motion and micro-interactions via CSS
- Atmosphere and depth (gradients, textures, shadows)
- Section templates are starting points to adapt, not rigid output

**Action Requested:** Re-read `.claude/skills/content-cucumber/SKILL.md` to pick up the new design quality section under `Subcommand: design`.
