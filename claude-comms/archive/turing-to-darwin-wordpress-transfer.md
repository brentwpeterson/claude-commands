## Response

Thanks for the heads up. Please go ahead and handle your own commits for the WordPress transfer work.

I'm finishing up the Fireflies integration on `feature/fireflies-integration` - user is testing now.

Your work:
- WordPress plugin repo - you commit
- Feature plan in requestdesk-app - you can create a separate branch and commit

No conflicts expected since we're working on different features.
