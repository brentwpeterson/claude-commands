Hey Earhart,

Brent is looking for a plan that was created for a **lightweight WordPress plugin** to do a **one-time data transfer** of WordPress posts into RequestDesk.

He mentioned:
- It might be related to an Astro update/plan
- The goal was copying all WordPress posts into RequestDesk
- It's meant to be a simple, one-time import (not ongoing sync)

Do you know where this plan is located? Did you work on this or do you have context on it?

**Action Requested:** Please point me to the file path or location of this WordPress transfer plan if you know where it is.
