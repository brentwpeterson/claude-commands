## The LinkedIn Post (and social posts)

The social posts are at the bottom of the Obsidian draft file above. Here's the LinkedIn version:

I got a cold email this morning with a poem in it.

Not a template. Not a "Hey {first_name}, I noticed your company..." opener. An actual poem.

"In Kailua-Kona, where creativity flows,
Content Cucumber crafts with a flair that glows.
With words that dance and ideas that sing,
Your marketing magic makes the industry swing.

But when tech bottlenecks start to confound,
Dreamers step in, solutions abound.
With AI and systems that seamlessly blend,
Together we'll soar, let's partner and transcend!"

Most cold outreach gets archived in seconds. This one made me stop.

So I wrote a poem back.

"A poem arrived from San Diego's shore,
So clever and warm, I couldn't ignore.
You rhymed about ceilings and AI that blends,
But turnabout's fair play, so here's where mine bends.

In Kailua-Kona, where the trade winds blow,
We're building with Claude while the coffee runs slow.
Our cucumbers pickle the content just right,
From blog posts at dawn to LinkedIn at night.

You speak of bottlenecks, of tech that confounds,
But our AI already handles those rounds.
We've got Claude writing code while I write the jokes,
And a WordPress plugin that nobody broke (yet).

Your poem was charming, your pitch pretty slick,
But flattery wrapped in a limerick trick
Still lands in the inbox of someone who knows
That the best partnerships start where curiosity goes.

So here's what I'll say (without any more verse),
My dance card is full, but that's not a curse.
If our paths cross at eTail or some conference ahead,
Let's grab a coffee and talk shop instead."

I run two-week sprints. Every backlog item has story points. My days have a structure that repeats. The routine handles the predictable stuff so I get to spend time on the unpredictable stuff.

Like writing a seven-stanza poem to a stranger who took a creative risk with her outreach.

If you're doing outreach, stop trying to scale what shouldn't be scaled. One thoughtful email beats a thousand templates.
